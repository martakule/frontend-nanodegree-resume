Welcome to my resume project!

It is live here: https://martakule.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-resume/

I have made minor changes to helper.js in order to have urls as links on the text that was tagged with `<a href="#">`.

I also removed `<em>` tags from html and any italics from CSS because the typeface I'm using (and the one used originally) doesn't contain italics, and regular font mechanically forced into a slant doesn't look good at all.

My html and css treatment is very light. I maintained the structure and just tinkered a little with colours, font, spacing, and some element placement.

Enjoy!

Marta
